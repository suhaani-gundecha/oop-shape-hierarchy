# Shape Hierarchy Using Object-Oriented Programming

This project was developed as part of an academic OOP laboratory assignment.

## Overview
The program implements a base `Shape` class with derived classes such as `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`, and `Square`. Each derived class overrides a method to calculate area using **runtime polymorphism**.

## Enhancements
- Input validation for invalid dimensions
- Modular class design for easy extension
- Added `Square` class to extend hierarchy

## Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- C++ Programming

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
g++ src/main.cpp -o ShapeProgram
./ShapeProgram
